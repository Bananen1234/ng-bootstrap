## THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED!

The code works as is but has been deprecated in favor for [Green](https://github.com/sebgroup/green) which is SEB:s new design system.

## Install with npm

```
npm install @sebgroup/bootstrap --save
```

For more info please see the [wiki](https://github.com/sebgroup/bootstrap/wiki)

## Use sebgroup/bootstrap with libraries such as Angular and/or React

sebgroup/bootstrap was created to be framework agnostic ie. it will never contain code for any particular JavaScript framework, so it's going to work with your framework as long as you use the right markup. If you need more complex components such as datepickers, advanced tables, multiselect dropdowns etc. checkout these libraries:

### Angular 2+

[**ng-bootstrap**](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/) - A set of angular components using Bootstrap 4 markup
[**angular-generic-table**](https://hjalmers.github.io/angular-generic-table/start) - A smarter table component

## Development server

Run `ng start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
